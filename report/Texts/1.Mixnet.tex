Additionally, each encryption layer includes an integrity tag, which prevents tampering and improves the networkâ€™s resistance against malicious mixnodes and active adversaries.
This means that each packet follows a different path rather than using the same intermediate nodes during the whole communication.
 
To further prevent correlation, mixnet relies on fixed-size packet format such as Sphinx packet (section \ref{sec:sphinx}), making it difficult for external observers to link incoming and outgoing messages at any given node.
In summary, mixnets provide stronger privacy guarantees than onion routing at the cost of increased latency.
