\subsection{Mixnet systems}
Since Chaumâ€™s seminal work on untraceable email in 1981~\cite{chaum-mix}, there has been a great amount of research re
lated to mixnets, both in system design~\cite{piotrowska2017loopix, van2015vuvuzela, kwon2020xrd, lazar2018karaoke} as in mechanism and schemes that enhance the anonymity and privacy of systems~\cite{coconut, benguirat2023blending}. We highlight in this section the most relevant prior work in terms of mixnet's designs.


explain and say that these systems they only work for their own service Unlike Nym that is supposed to as a privacy networks for other services (similar to Tor). Ben Guirat et. al, showed in this work that blending traffic is actually useful in terms of the privacy provided by the overall network.
However unlike tor, mixnets can be expensive due to cryptographic operations.
and hence
also nides are being paid and incentiviiwed through a their computation loads and hence they shouldnt waste traffic for later to be dropped at the last hop.
 
motivate why we are focusing on nym though this aplied to other mixnets
